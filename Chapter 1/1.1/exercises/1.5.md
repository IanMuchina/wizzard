# Exercise 1.5
## Question
Ben Bitdiddle has invented a test to determine whether the interpreter he is faced with is using:

* Applicative-order evaluation or 
* Normal-order evaluation. 

He defines the following two procedures:
```scheme
(define (p) (p))

(define (test x y) 
  (if (= x 0) 
      0 
      y))
```

Then he evaluates the expression

```scheme
(test 0 (p))
```

What behavior will Ben observe with an interpreter that uses applicative-order evaluation? 

What behavior will he observe with an interpreter that uses normal-order evaluation? 

## Answer

Look at the function/procedure `p` ...
```
(define (p) (p))
```
It is self defining. It is infinite. It will never evaluate. It runs forever.

*(I think)* it's valid scheme. My interpreter doesn't complain. It just stays in this infinite loop.
---

Let's take a look at the if statement:

```scheme
(if (= x 0)
    0
    y)
```

This is how it looks like when the `test` function is given 0 and p as arguments.
```scheme
(if (= 0 0)
    0
    p)
```

If the interpreter evaluates `p` before needing it, the code will run forever. 

If the interpreter is lazy and only gets what's necessary, it will be quicker and return 0. 


The fast "only evaluate what's needed intepreter? -> **Normal order**

The forever everything needs to be evaluated intepreter? -> **Applicative order**
